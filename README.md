Brief Description: I made a website that would give you all the info of a pokemon, kinda like a pokedex

Peer Reviewer: Alexander Soria
Review: The layout of the site is very nice. It's responsive and fits in a mobile and tablet set up. Some of the functionality is missing, such as the other necessary date for the pokemon. The random button also seems to be not working as intended, but the presentation is still pretty good.
